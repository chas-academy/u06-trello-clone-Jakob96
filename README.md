A trello like app where user can add, remove, change and archive cards. New lists can be added as well.

The data is stored in local storage. 

## Technology:
HTML5 / SASS
Jquery UI / JS
Custom widget

I choosed to use the sortable component because it has the functionality for sorting built in and makes the code more readable and shorter.
